# Privacy Policy for Joynal

**Last Updated:** May 5, 2025

Menglu Zhu ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Joynal application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.

**Information Collection and Use**

Joynal is designed with your privacy in mind.

* **Journal Entries:** All journal entries ("Joys") you create within the App are stored **locally on your device only**. We do not have access to, collect, or store your journal entries on any external servers. Your diary content remains private to you.
* **No Personal Information Collected:** We do not collect any personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, location, or device identifiers through the App.
* **No Usage Data Collected:** We do not collect information on how the App is accessed or used (Usage Data).

**Data Storage**

Your journal data is stored exclusively on your local device storage managed by the operating system. If you delete the App, your journal data stored within the App's container may also be deleted, unless you have manually exported it using the App's TXT export feature.

**Data Export and Import**

The App provides functionality to export your journal entries as plain TXT files and import data from TXT files. This process is initiated by you and managed locally on your device. Exported files are saved to the location you choose on your device.

**LLM Prompt for Migration**

The App provides a text prompt template to assist users in converting diary data from other formats using external Large Language Model (LLM) services. This conversion process occurs entirely outside the Joynal App. We do not process or have access to the data you use with external LLM services.

**Children's Privacy**

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
